	abstract =	{MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS in short) is an MPLS data plane-based source routing paradigm in which the sender of a packet is allowed to partially or completely specify the route the packet takes through the network by imposing stacked MPLS labels on the packet. SR-MPLS could be leveraged to realize a source routing mechanism across MPLS, IPv4, and IPv6 data planes by using an MPLS label stack as a source routing instruction set while preserving backward compatibility with SR-MPLS. This document describes how SR-MPLS capable routers and IP-only routers can seamlessly co-exist and interoperate through the use of SR-MPLS label stacks and IP encapsulation/tunneling such as MPLS-in- UDP as defined in RFC 7510.},

A vswitch forwards traffic between different virtual machines (VMs) on the same physical host and also forwards traffic between VMs and the physical network. Open vSwitch is open to programmatic extension and control using OpenFlow and the OVSDB (Open vSwitch Database) management protocol. This document defines the OVSDB management protocol. The Open vSwitch project includes open-source OVSDB client and server implementations.},
