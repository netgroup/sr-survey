\begin{abstract}
Telco Operators were suffering from lack of flexibility and scalability to realize an increasing variety of cloud based services, meet the demand for more bandwidth and keep the costs low and infrastructures agile. Since 2012 Segment Routing (SR) architecture, also known as Source Packet Routing In Networking (SPRING) in the Internet Engineering Task Force, has been proposed as solution aimed at filling this gap. SR founds its architecture on the source routing and tunneling paradigms, becoming a promising solution to support services like Traffic Engineering and Virtual Private Networks in IP backbones and datacenters. SR architecture has also interesting scalability properties, as it reduces the amount of state information that needs to be configured in the core nodes since devices steer packets over paths using a sequence of instructions (segments) placed in the packet header at the ingress of the network. Two instantations exist of the Segment Routing architecture: it can be implemented using either the MPLS or the IPv6 data plane. Recently, the IPv6 SR architecture (SRv6) has been extended from the simple steering of packets across nodes to a general network programming approach by the Internet draft SRv6 Network Programming making SRv6 architecture appealing to new use cases like Service Function chaining and Network Function Virtualization.

In this paper we present a comprehensive survey on SR technology analyzing research activities, standardization efforts and implementation results. Firstly, we introduce the motivation for Segment Routing and its evolution from its public first in 2012. Then, we provide a common ground and a reference conceptual framework for the survey using a bottom-up approach. Next, we analyze research activities using a categorization approach. We have identified 7 main categories during our analysis of the current state of the art. They are respectively Monitoring, Traffic Engineering, Failure Recovery, Centrally Controlled Architectures, Path Encoding, Network Programming and Miscellaneous. We also look to the path of the standardization efforts, we describe the main 9 standardization efforts and we list other ongoing activities and provide pointers to them. Last but not least, we elaborate on the implementation results and we provide references for tutorials, source code and ready-to-go virtual setups.
