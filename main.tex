{P.L. Ventre \MakeLowercase{\textit{et al.}}: Segment Routing: A comprehensive survey of research activities, standardization efforts and implementation results}

\begin{comment} Telco Operators were suffering from lack of flexibility and scalability to realize an increasing variety of cloud based services, meet the demand for more bandwidth and keep the costs low and infrastructures agile. Since 2012 Segment Routing (SR) architecture, also known as Source Packet Routing In Networking (SPRING) in the Internet Engineering Task Force, has been proposed as solution aimed at filling this gap. SR founds its architecture on the source routing and tunneling paradigms, becoming a promising solution to support services like Traffic Engineering and Virtual Private Networks in IP backbones and datacenters. SR architecture has also interesting scalability properties, as it reduces the amount of state information that needs to be configured in the core nodes since devices steer packets over paths using a sequence of instructions (segments) placed in the packet header at the ingress of the network. Two instantations exist of the Segment Routing architecture: it can be implemented using either the MPLS or the IPv6 data plane. Recently, the IPv6 SR architecture (SRv6) has been extended from the simple steering of packets across nodes to a general network programming approach by the Internet draft SRv6 Network Programming making SRv6 architecture appealing to new use cases like Service Function chaining and Network Function Virtualization. \end{comment}

\begin{abstract} 
Fixed and mobile telecom operators, enterprise network operators and cloud providers strive to face the challenging demands coming from the evolution of IP networks (e.g. huge bandwidth requirements, integration of billions of devices and millions of services in the cloud). Proposed in the early 2010's, the Segment Routing (SR) architecture helps facing these challenging demands and it is being adopted and deployed. The SR architecture is based on the concept of source routing and has interesting scalability properties as it dramatically reduces the amount of state information to be configured in the core nodes to support complex services. The SR architecture has been first implemented with the MPLS dataplane and then, quite recently, with the IPv6 dataplane (SRv6). The IPv6 SR architecture (SRv6) has been extended from the simple steering of packets across nodes to a general \textit{network programming} approach, making it very suitable for use cases like Service Function Chaining and Network Function Virtualization. 
In this paper we present a tutorial and a comprehensive survey on the SR technology, analyzing standardization efforts, research activities and implementation results. We start with an introduction on the motivations for Segment Routing and an overview of its evolution and standardization. Then, we provide a tutorial on the Segment Routing technology, with focus on the novel SRv6 solution. We discuss the standardization efforts, providing details on the most important documents and mentioning other ongoing activities. Then, we thoroughly analyze the research activities according to a taxonomy. We have identified \numCoveredCategories main categories during our analysis of the current state of the art: Monitoring, Traffic Engineering, Failure Recovery, Centrally Controlled Architectures, Path Encoding, Network Programming, Performance Evaluation and Miscellaneous. We report the current status of SR deployments in production networks and of SR implementations (including several open source projects). Finally, we identify a set of future research directions related to for the Segment Routing.
