# SR-Survey
Segment Routing Survey is the project hosting the source of the survey "Segment Routing: A comprehensive survey of research activities, standardization efforts and implementation results". The project is organized in several sub-folders:

    .   -> folder containing main.tex, references.bib, fig and sec folders
    fig -> folder containing the figures of the survey
    sec -> folder containing chapters of the survey

### How to contribute ###

We aim to run the survey as an open source project. For this reason, we encourage people to contribute using the standard github workflow: opening issues, submitting pull requests and so on.
